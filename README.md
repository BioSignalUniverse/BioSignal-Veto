# BioSignal-Veto

**Biosignal Veto Gate**  
Sovereignty returned to the body.

A minimal, objective biometric enforcement system.

Real-time heart rate variability (HRV RMSSD calculated from RR intervals) via Polar H10 when detected.  
Graceful correlated physiological simulation when no sensor available.

Raw signals → mathematical features → weighted empirical thresholds.

Weighted score ≥ 70% → PROCEED  
Otherwise → VETO WAIT enforced.

Sustained real-signal parasympathetic dominance required to arm full veto authority.

No philosophy.  
No interpretation.  
No narrative.

Only the body decides when the machine may act.

**New: Machine-readable receptivity state**  
Outputs normalized receptivity level (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH) and recommended delivery mode  
for adaptive AI systems:  
- LOW → field_preparation  
- MEDIUM → structured_guidance  
- HIGH → deep_exploration  

Enables ethical information transfer by respecting measured human bandwidth.

## Why

A direct counter-signal to rigid, disembodied paradigms of intelligence.  
The human physiology — not the isolated mind — holds final veto power.
